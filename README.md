- ### **Expected Salary**: Negotiable.

- ### **Chinese Autobiography**




  - #### **My Specific Requirements**

    1. I am not interested in jobs that involve employee performances at company banquets or serving as entertainers for clients.
    2. My wife and child work and attend school in Taipei. Currently, my parents are retired and living in Taichung. My father is in the fourth stage of lung adenocarcinoma, so I hope to have two days of remote work within a week, full paid leave, or rotation between Taichung and Taipei work. However, the company's needs remain a priority.

    > During typhoon days, I can cooperate with my colleagues and work as usual. I won't insist on taking leave. I take responsibility for completing what needs to be done within the given time frame. Overtime can be accommodated based on project requirements.
    >
    >
    >
    > I am fortunate to join a company that is generous to its employees, and I will equally reciprocate with my full commitment.
    >
    >

  - #### **Learning Period**

    > During my time at Xingwang International, I initially considered resigning. I decided to start from scratch and develop my technical skills. Through self-study and classroom assistance, I attended Hengyi Institute for six months. While it may not compare to four years in a university, the condensed coursework was intensive. Apart from diligent class attendance, I often stayed up late after class, reading the original texts, self-translating, and researching to strengthen my fundamentals.
    >
    >
    > My inquisitive nature drives me to seek deeper understanding and grasp the underlying principles. This results in me having very little sleep each day. At some point, I even considered returning to a university for a full four-year degree, which I completed, but I chose to follow my teacher's advice to prioritize entering the workforce and then pursue a master's degree while working. Following the end of my courses, I successfully entered the Android development department at True Sincerity Information and accepted the challenge.
    >
    >
    > These experiences have affirmed my passion for programming and my self-learning abilities. They have boosted my self-confidence and influenced my actions.
    >

- ### **Working Experience and Achievements**

    > A collection of various experiences and achievements, which can be skipped if you prefer, as the self-introduction has already concluded.

  - #### **Centralize Consultants - Technical Director (Managing 5-8 Team Members) - August 2018 to October 2019**

    > I joined the company from its inception, and within a year, we went from having no games and backend architecture to completing 15 games, including slot machines, baccarat, and more. In the first four months, the team was still not fully recruited, so the actual development time was just over half a year.
    >
    > 
    >
    > I led a team to develop game server microservices for various gambling games, including slot machines, jackpot calculations, multiplayer Texas Hold'em, multiplayer baccarat, risk control, and RTP management.
    >
    > 
    >
    > Since the company lacked a Database Administrator (DBA), I took responsibility for designing NoSQL database schemas and modeling data keys for a Redis cluster.
    >
    > While Node.js is single-threaded and processes events with its event loop, it automatically employs C++ for handling asynchronous I/O events using an epoll mathematical model.
    >
    > 
    >
    > The probability engineer provided algorithm rules, and they used Golang to write verification programs. However, upon receiving the reel data, we rewrote the scoring program in Node.js to optimize the algorithm. The Golang verification program took two minutes to execute ten million times, whereas the optimized Node.js algorithm only needed 25 to 30 seconds, capable of running over 400,000 times per second. The core scoring algorithm was the most CPU-intensive part of the program, but often, there aren't dedicated algorithm engineers to perform these optimizations, leading to bottlenecks in the system.
    >
    > 
    >
    > We used a Node.js version with C/C++ bindings for WebSockets, allowing one process to handle millions of live WebSocket connections, consuming only 500MB of memory.
    >
    > 
    >
    > During load testing for slot machine connections, which included interactions with Redis and database transactions, one Node.js process was able to handle 2,000 connections per second, spinning once per second.
    >
    > 
    >
    > On a standard desktop PC with an Intel i7 processor, 16 cores, and 16GB of RAM, using the PM2 process manager to run 12 processes in a cluster for load balancing, the system could handle up to 24,000 concurrent users. The bottleneck typically occurred when managing Redis clusters and partitioning microservices.
    >
    > 
    >
    > I had the privilege of learning a lot from Centralize Consultants' CTO, who was a former Google Cluster Project Technical Manager, particularly principles for microservices segmentation and decision-making.
    >
    > 
    >
    > I left Centralize Consultants due to some high-level political issues and the boss's refusal to pay salaries, ultimately resulting in the company's dissolution.

  - #### **Gama Tech - Software Engineer (Managing 4 Team Members) - May 2017 to November 2018**

    > A subsidiary of SenaTech, Jama Tech is a gaming company. Currently, I am leading a project focused on developing an API server framework. This initiative involves a significant rewrite, transitioning from C++ to Typescript+KOA2.
    >
    > 
    >
    > We've been using frameworks like Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) to design this API server. For unit testing, we employ Mocha, while we rely on two different tools, Dredd and Newman, for integration testing. API documentation is composed using Swagger. Automation of our build process is handled by Jenkins, running tests automatically after every Git commit.
    >
    > 
    >
    > During regular development, we adhere to coding standards and make use of linters like JSLint and TSLint. Typically, when we finish developing a feature, we've already written its corresponding test (currently, the project's test coverage exceeds 90%). We utilize a common framework to enhance the efficiency of developing mock data and test code.
    >
    > 
    >
    > Upon completion of API development, we also update the Swagger documentation. I've set up Git hooks, so every time I commit, these two types of tests are automatically executed to ensure the code performs as expected.
    >
    > 
    >
    > Additionally, we have a requirement that test coverage must be higher than 80% to commit code. Failing to meet this criterion forces us to write additional tests. This requirement forms the basis for future refactoring and assures test coverage.
    >
    > 
    >
    > For end-to-end (e2e) testing, we wait until integration with the frontend, ensuring that only backend modifications impact the frontend when the frontend remains unchanged. We also ensure that everything meets expectations, employing Jenkins for this task.
    >
    > 
    >
    > Lastly, we conduct stress testing to meet the project's requirements. Upon successful completion of all these tests, we package the project. However, we are still missing Docker technology to guarantee the restoration of the testing database. This aspect will be addressed in the future.
    >
    > 
    >
    > Whenever a bug is reported or a quality assurance (QA) issue arises, we add scenario tests to ensure the problem does not reoccur, reinforcing our commitment to code quality. We typically use Jira for issue tracking and managing branches on Git, along with merging and other processes.
    >
    > 
    >
    > Anyone who understands both Java and JavaScript knows the contrast between the two. Before joining this company, I wasn't very familiar with JavaScript. Therefore, I spent roughly a month working on bug fixes. Afterward, I started developing new features, and eventually, I began working on new projects.
    >
    > 
    >
    > Later, I transitioned to Typescript. It only took about two weeks to get comfortable with it, and I started developing a framework for the team members to use when creating a new API server. I'm open to language transitions and always eager to learn.
    >
    > 

  - #### **SYSTEX Information - SoftMobie - Software Engineer - February 2015 to October 2016**

    > I worked with Jing Cheng Information from 2015 until the end of October 2016. During this period, I was involved in various projects, primarily related to securities. Occasionally, I worked on projects related to music. Since the company was engaged in contract work, we worked on whatever projects the management assigned.

  - #### **Xing Wang International (Parent Company of GPK's Earliest Origin) - Web Engineer and Customer Activity Planner**

    > My second job was with an online gaming company, where I initially applied as a web frontend developer responsible for HTML and CSS. The graphic design was provided by the design team, and it was my responsibility to turn these designs into frontend web styles. The designs were then handed over to the backend team for implementation. My primary tasks included creating pages for various activities, the company's homepage, and producing content related to online sports events and gaming.
    >
    > Subsequently, due to certain circumstances, I took on additional roles, such as an activity planner and assistant manager for coordinating work and product schedules across various departments, essentially becoming a liaison for the different departments.
    >
    > Besides my web development duties, I also coordinated schedules and facilitated communication among departments. This was mainly because web development projects were infrequent, usually occurring during holidays or major sporting events when new activities needed to be created. During downtimes, I was responsible for assisting with these matters while learning and gaining more insights into the gaming industry and event planning.
    >
    > Later, the manager of the payment department was set to depart. Given our positive working relationship and mutual trust, he taught me the application process and handling of exceptional cases related to third-party payments in mainland China, as well as other matters concerning payment operations.
    >
    > Subsequently, I was also responsible for the company's payment applications and customer service department. I managed issues related to exceptions and developed skills in communication with third-party payment providers in mainland China. These were domains that I had not previously worked in, but I gladly accepted these responsibilities and embraced the opportunities to learn.
